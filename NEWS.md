- Added birdmoves shiny app to feedr package (`birdmoves()`)



# feedr 0.6.0 (2016-06-20)

This update fixes a couple of small bugs and mostly involves rewriting code to use `dplyr`/`tidyr` as opposed to `plyr`/`reshape2`, and further includes `magrittr` as an import. 

- Clarify error codes
- Fix scaling errors in mapping
- Fix examples to match newer options (especially in `move()`)
