\usage{
load_raw_all(r_dir, r_list, pattern = "DATA", tz = Sys.timezone(),
  tz_disp = NULL, dst = FALSE, details = 1, logger_pattern = NA,
  time_format = "mdy HMS", extra_pattern = NULL, extra_name = NULL,
  sep = "", skip = 0, verbose = TRUE, feeder_pattern)
}
\arguments{
\item{r_dir}{Character. The director that holds all your raw data files (can
be in subdirectories).}

\item{r_list}{Character. A list of files to import.}

\item{pattern}{Character. A regular expression pattern that matches the files
you wish to include. Defaults to "DATA" to include only DATA files and not
NOTE files.}

\item{tz}{Character. The time zone the date/times are in (should match one of
the zones produced by \code{OlsonNames())}. Attempts to use user's system
timezone, if none supplied. Defaults to UTC if all else fails.}

\item{tz_disp}{Character. The time zone the date/times should be displayed in
(if not the same as \code{tz}; should match one of the zones produced by
\code{OlsonNames())}.}

\item{dst}{Logical. Whether or not to use Daylight Savings. When set to FALSE
timezones are converted to the Etc/GMT+X timezones which do not include
DST. (Note this overrides the timezone specification such that a timezone
of America/Vancouver, which would normally include DST in the summer, will
be transformed to a timezone with the same GMT offset, but not including
DST).}

\item{details}{Numeric. Where to find logger details, either 0 (file name),
1 (first line) or 2 (first two lines). See 'details'.}

\item{logger_pattern}{Character. A regular expression matching the logger id
in the file name. NA (default) matches file name (extension omitted) or
first line of the file (See the \code{details} argument). Alternatively,
"[GPR]{2,3}[0-9]{1,2}" would match the names of TRU loggers.}

\item{time_format}{Character. The date/time format of the 'date' and 'time'
columns combined. Defaults to "mdy HMS". Should be in formats usable by the
\code{parse_date_time()} function from the lubridate package (e.g., "ymd
HMS", "mdy HMS", "dmy HMS", etc.). See details for more information.}

\item{extra_pattern}{Character vector. A vector of regular expressions
matching any extra information in the file or directory names.}

\item{extra_name}{Character vector. A vector of column names matching the
order of \code{extra_pattern} for storing the results of the pattern.}

\item{sep}{Character. An override for the separator in the
\code{read.table()} call (see \code{sep =} under \code{?read.table} for
more details).}

\item{skip}{Character. Extra lines to skip in addition to the lines specified
by details.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Whether to include progress messages or not.}

\item{feeder_pattern}{Deprecated. Use logger_pattern instead.}
}
\description{
This is a wrapper function which loads and combines raw data files. If
\code{r_dir} is specified, these include all files in series of nested
folders, if \code{r_list} is specified it includes only the list of files
specified.
}
\details{
Note that if both \code{r_dir} and \code{r_list} are specified, the directory
overrides the file list.

Each data file is assumed to contain three columns (without column names)
corresponding to \code{animal_id}, \code{date} and \code{time} (without
date). By default they are expected to be separated by white space, but the
\code{sep} argument can be modified to reflect other separators, such as
comma- or tab-separated data.

The columns \code{date} and \code{time} will be combined to extract the
date/time of each event. Thus, the \code{time_format} argument specifies the
order of the combined date and time columns and should be in formats usable
by the \code{\link[lubridate]{parse_date_time()}} function from the
\link{lubridate} package (e.g., "ymd HMS", "mdy HMS", "dmy HMS", etc.). For
example, the default "mdy HMS" expects a date column in the format of
month/day/year and a time column in the format of H:M:S (note that separators
and leading zeros are ignored, thus month-day-year is equivalent to
month/day/year, see the \code{order} argument of the
\link[lubridate]{parse_date_time} function for more information. More complex
formats can also be specified:  For example, 09/30/16 2:00 pm can be
specified by time_format = "mdy HM p".

Logger details are the logger_id and the lat/lon for the logger. A value of 0
reflects that the logger_id is in the file name, defined by the pattern
logger_pattern. A value of 1 reflects that the logger_id is in the first line
of the file, also defined by the pattern logger_pattern. A value of 2
reflects that in addition to the logger_id being in the first line ofthe
file, the lat/lon information is on the second line, in the format of
"latitude, longitude" both in decimal format (spacing doesn't matter, but the
comma does).
