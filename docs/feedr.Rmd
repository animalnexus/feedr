This is an overview of how to use functions in the `feedr` package to transform and visual your RFID data.

## Order of operations
This package contains functions to perform three broad services: 

1. __Loading/Importing Data__  
    Raw data downloaded from the feeders or from the birdmoves website 
2. __Housekeeping__  
    Functions for checking and correcting errors before you transform the data
3. __Transformations__  
    When raw data is transformed into visit data, feeding data, etc. which are the output of the `visits()`, `feeding()`, etc. functions
4. __Visualizations__  
    Static or interactive maps produced by the mapping functions which visualize the movement and feeding patterns around your feeders.


As such, several functions depend on the output of other functions.

For example, to get daily activity patterns, you could get your data from the web with `dl_data()`, turn this raw data to visits data with `visits()`, turn visits data to activity data with `activity()` and finally, turn activity data into daily activity patterns with `daily()`.

```{r, echo = F, fig.align='center'}
DiagrammeR::grViz("
digraph order {

graph [overlap = true, compound = true]

node[shape = Mrecord]
edge[arrowhead = vee]

load[label = '{Loading/Importing Data | {load_raw_all() | load_web() | dl_data()}}']

hk[label = '{Housekeeping (Optional) | {check_ids() | check_problems()}}', width = 3]

load -> hk
hk -> visits
load -> visits

visits[label = 'visits()']
disp[label = 'disp()']
dom[label = 'dom()']
move[label = 'move()']
feed[label = 'feeding()']
act[label = 'activity()']
daily[label = 'daily()']

visits-> {disp, move, feed}
feed -> act
disp -> dom
act -> daily

map[label = '{Visualizations | {map_ggmap() | map_leaflet()}}']

{feed; move} -> map

#A -> e [ltail = cluster0, lhead = cluster1]
#f -> 'visits()' [ltail = cluster1, lhead = cluster2]
#'move()' -> 'map_leaflet()' [ltail = cluster2, lhead = cluster3]

}
", width = 500)
```

## Tutorial Data
A data frame called 'finches' is included in this package for the purpose of demonstration. You can access this package by mearly typing in `finches`.

## Function Index

### [Loading/Importing Data](load.html)

- __load_raw():__ Load in a single file of raw feeder data
- __load_raw_all():__ Load in and combine multiple files of raw feeder data
- __load_web():__ Load in csv file previously downloaded
- __dl_data():__ Download and load data directly from the birdmoves website

### [Housekeeping](housekeeping.html)

- __check_ids():__ Remove known bad ids (i.e. errors, wands, etc.)
- __check_problems():__ Fix known id problems

### [Transformations](transformations.html)

- __visits():__ Turn raw data into visits data
- __move():__ Turn visits data into movements between feeders
- __feeding():__ Turn visits data into feeding bouts
- __disp():__ Turn visits data into displacements
- __dom():__ Turn displacements into dominance matrices and hierarchies
- __activity():__ Turn visits data into activity data
- __daily():__ Turn activity data into daily activity patterns

## [Visualizations](maps.html)

- __map_ggmap():__ Visualize movements and/or feeding bouts with ggmap (static)
- __map_leaflet():__ Visualize movements and/or feeding bouts with leaflet (interactive)
