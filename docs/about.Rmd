## `feedr`

The `feedr` package for R is a collection of functions and shiny apps designed to help with loading, checking, transforming and visualizing RFID data, or other data types collected from static stations.

This package includes a companion website, <http://animalnexus.ca>, designed to provide a simple user-interface to access package functions and the animalnexus data base without having to use R.

The `feedr` package can be found on [github](https://github.com/animalnexus/feedr) along with basic installation instructions.

See the "Help" tab at <http://animalnexus.ca> for more information about us and the animalnexus project.
